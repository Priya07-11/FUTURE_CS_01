# FUTURE_CS_01

This repo is where I dove into real web app hacking for the first time. I tried out SQL injection, XSS and CSRF on DVWA, played around with tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap and slowly started making sense of how these attacks actually work. All my findings, screenshots and fixes are wrapped up in a report. It feels awesome looking back at how much I learned!!
